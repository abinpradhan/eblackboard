usable as it it automounted by the system. This must be unmounted 
and mounted as /cdrive


Remote shell to the OSMC device

root@osmc:/home/osmc# mount /cdrive
Mount is denied because the NTFS volume is already exclusively opened.
The volume may be already mounted, or another software may use it which
could be identified for example by the help of the 'fuser' command.
